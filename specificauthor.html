    <ul class="b">
    	<li>A wretched soul,burised with adversity,We bid be quite when we hear it cry;But were we burdened with like weight of pain,as much more or we should ourselves complain</li>
    	<li>Action is eloquence.</li>
    	<li>And since you know you cannot see yourself,ao well as by reflection,I,your glass, will modestly discover to yourself,that of yourself which you yet know not of</li>
    	<li>And thus I clothe my naked villainy With old odd ends,stol'n forth of holywrit;And seems a saint,when most i play the devil</li>
    	<li>Assume a virtue, if you have it not</li>
    	<li>Be great in act,as you have be in thoughts.</li>
         <li>Blow,Blow,thou winter wind  Thou art not so unkind,As man's ingratitude</li>
        <li>Conversation should be pleasant without scurrility,witty without affection ,free without indecency,learned without conceitedness,novel without falsehood</li>
        <li>Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger constant in spirit,not swerving with the blood,garnish'd and deck'd in modest compliment, not working with the eye without the ear,and but in purged judgement trusting neither?Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem</li>
        <li>Glory is like a circle in water,which never ceasth to enlarge to itself,Till by broad spreading it disperses to naught</li>
         <li>God bless thee;and put meekness in thy mind,love,charity,obedience,and true duty!</li>
         <li>He who has injured thee was either stronger or weaker than thee .If weaker ,spare him; if stronger ,spare thyself.</li>
         <li>How poor are they who have not patience! What wound did ever heal but by degrees</li>
         <li>I am not bound to please thee with my answers</li>
         <li>I must be cruel only to be kind; Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.</li>
         <li>If it be a sin to covet honor, I am the most offending soul</li>

 <li><h2><a name="Martin">Martin luther king</a></h2></li>
    <ul class="b">
    	<li>A nation or civilization that continues to produce soft-minded men purchases its own spiritual death on an installment plan</li>
    	<li>All men are caught in an inescapable network of mutality</li>
    	<li>Faith is taking the first step,even when you don't see the whole staricase</li>
    	<li>Hatred paralyzes life;love harmonizes it;Hatred darknes life;love illuminates it.</li>
    	<li>Human salvation lies in the hands of creatively maladjusted </li>
    	<li>I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.That is why right,temporarily defeated ,is stronger than evil triumphant.</li>
    	<li>I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice,is in reality expressing the highest respect  for the law </li>
    	<li>If an man is called to be a streetsweeper ,even as Michelangelo painted ,or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry.He should sweep streets so well that all the hists of heaven and eartyh will pause to say,here lived a great streetsweeper who did his job so perfectly</li>
    	<li>Let no man pull you enough low to hate him.</li>
    	<li>like an chchecked cancer,hate corrodes the personality and eats away its  vital unity.Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity. It cause him, to describe beautiful as ugly and ugly as beautiful,and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true. </li>
    	<li>Our life begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.</li>
    </ul>

<li><h2><a name="Mahatama">Mahatama Gandhi</a></h2></li>
      <ul class="b">
      	<li>You must be the change you wish to see in the world</li>
      	<li>An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind.</li>
      	<li>A nation's culture resides in the hearts and in the soul of its people.</li>
      	<li>A coward is incapable of exhibiting love;it is the prerogative of the brave.</li>
      	<li>Live as if you were to die tomorrow.Learn as if you were to live forever.</li>
      	<li>Service which is rendered without joy helps neither the servant nor the served. </li>
      	<li>If you want real peace in the world,start with children.</li>
      	<li>If I have the belief that I can do it,i hall surely acquire the capacity to do it even if I may not have it at the beginning.
      	</li>
      	<li>Hate the sin,love the sinner</li>
      	<li>Glory lies in the attempt to reach one's gola and not in reaching it.</li>
      	<li>Whenever you are confronted with an opponent ,conquer him with love. </li>
      	<li>Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's needs,but not everyman's greed.</li>
        <li>Anger is the enemy of non-voilence and pride is a monster that swallows it up. </li>
      </ul>
 <li><h2><a name="Aristotle">Aristotle</a></h2></li>
      <ul class="b">
      	<li>A flatterer is a friend who is your inferior, or pretends to be so</li>
      	<li>A friend is a second self.</li>
      	<li>All human actions have one or more of these seven causes: chance, nature, compulsion, habit, reason, passion, and desire.</li>
      	<li>How many a dispute could have been deflated into a single paragraph if the disputants had dared to define their terms.</li>
      	<li>Education is the best provision for the journey to old age.</li>
      	<li>Humor is the only test of gravity, and gravity of humor; for a subject which will not bear raillery is suspicious, and a jest which will not bear serious examination is false wit.</li>
      	<li>Poverty is the parent of revolution and crime.</li>
      	<li>One swallow does not make a summer, neither does one fine day; similarly one day or brief time of happiness does not make a person entirely happy.</li>
      	<li>Young people are in a condition like permanent intoxication, because youth is sweet and they are growing.</li>
      	<li>Misfortune shows those who are not really friends.</li>
      </ul>
 <li><h2><a name="Abraham">Abraham Lincoln</a></h2></li>
      <ul class="b">
      <li>Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any one thing.</li>
      <li>As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master. This expresses my idea of democracy.</li>
      <li>Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can. As a peacemaker the lawyer has superior opportunity of being a good man. There will still be business enough.</li>
      <li>It is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him.</li>
      <li>No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.</li>
      <li>Most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.</li>
      <li>You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time.</li>
      <li>Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention.</li>
      <li>There is an important sense in which government is distinctive from administration. One is perpetual, the other is temporary and changeable. A man may be loyal to his government and yet oppose the particular principles and methods of administration.</li>
      </ul>
 <li><h2><a name="Mother">Mother Teresa</a></h2></li>
     <ul class="b">
     	<li>God doesn't require us to succeed; he only requires that you try.</li>
     	<li>I have found the paradox that if I love until it hurts, then there is no hurt, but only more love.</li>
     	<li>I know God will not give me anything I can't handle. I just wish that He didn't trust me so much.</li>
     	<li>Let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier.</li>
     	<li>Joy is prayer - Joy is strength - Joy is love - Joy is a net of love by which you can catch souls.</li>
     	<li>Whether one is Hindu or a Muslim or a Christian, how you live your life is proof that you are or not fully His. We cannot condemn or judge or pass words that will hurt people. We don't know in what way God is appearing to that soul and what God is drawing that soul to; therefor, who are we to condemn anybody?</li>
     	<li>What we do is less than a drop in the ocean. But if it were missing, the ocean would lack something.</li>
     	<li>We can do no great things; only small things with great love.</li>
     	<li>Let us make one point, that we meet each other with a smile, when it is difficult to smile. Smile at each other, make time for each other in your family.</li>

  <li><h2><a name="Barrack">Barrack Obama</a></h2></li>
     <ul class="b">
     	<li>Abraham Lincoln and Millard Fillmore had the same title. They were both presidents of the United States, but their tenure in office and their legacy could not be more different.</li>
     	<li>Acts of sacrifice and decency without regard to what's in it for you create ripple effects. Ones that lift up families and communities, that spread opportunity and boost our economy.</li>
     	<li>I know starting careers in troubled times is a challenge, but it is also a privilege. Because it's moments like these that force us to try harder, dig deeper and to discover gifts we never knew we had. To find the greatness that lies within each of us. So don't ever shy away from that endeavor. Don't stop adding to your body of work. I can promise that you will be the better for that continued effort as will be this nation that we all love.</li>
     	<li>That is the American story. People, just like you, following their passions, determined to meet the times on their own terms. They weren't doing it for the money. Their titles weren't fancy. But they changed the course of history and so can you.</li>

     	<li>It was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation.
        Yes we can.
       It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights.
        Yes we can.
        It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness.
        Yes we can.</li>
        <li>America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this.</li>

     	<li>"He from whom all beings originate, and by whom all this universe is pervaded; worshipping Him by performing one's natural duty for Him one attains perfection."</li>
     	<li>"This being the case; the ignorant person who considers oneself as the sole agent due to imperfect understanding does not understand."</li>
     	<li>"One feels infinite bliss that is perceivable only through the intellect, and is beyond the reach of the senses. After realizing Brahman, one is never separated from absolute reality."</li>

      	<li>Accidents will occur in the best regulated families.</li>
      	<LI>I do not know the American gentleman, god forgive me for putting two such words together.</LI>
         <li>
Reflect on your present blessings, of which every man has many; not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some.</li>
      <li>Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pound ought and six, result misery.</li>

  <li><h2><a name="Oscar">Oscar Wilde</a></h2></li>
      <ul class="b">
      	<li>A man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her.</li>
      	<li>A man is very apt to complain of the ingratitude of those who have risen far above him.</li>
      	<li>Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.</li>
      	<li>America is the only country that went from barbarism to decadence without civilization in between.</li>
      	<li>At twilight, nature is not without loveliness, though perhaps its chief use is to illustrate quotations from the poets.</li>
      	<li>Every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.</li>
      	<li>If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you.</li>
